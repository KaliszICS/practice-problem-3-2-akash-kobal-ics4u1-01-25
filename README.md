# Instructions  

Create a function called towerOfHanoi(int num). Use recursion to return the number of moves it will take complete the towerOfHanoi problem with num amount of rings.

return -1 if they input a number less than 3.

Spend your time figuring out the problem and ensure you are using the absolute minimum number of moves. Use recursion!
